# TellerFlowOptimizer

## Introduction

This program simulates a bank with multiple tellers and customers.
A bank service area consists of several tellers and a customer queue.
In each time unit, at most one new customer arrives at the queue.
If the queue is too long, the customer leaves without completing their
transaction; otherwise, the customer gets into the queue.
If all tellers are busy, customers in the queue must wait for a teller.
If a teller is free and customers are waiting, the first customer in the queue
advances to the teller's counter and begins their transaction.
When a customer is done, they depart and the teller becomes free.
The simulation is run through many units of time.
At the end of each time unit, the program prints out a snapshot of the queues,
customers, and tellers.
The program ends with printing out statistics of the simulation.

## Assumptions and Requirements

### Assumptions

* At most one customer arrives per time unit
* All numbers are positive integer numbers (>=0), except average values
should be displayed to two decimal places
* No time lost in between the following events:
    * a customer arriving and entering the queue
    * a customer arriving and leaving without banking
    * a customer completing their transaction and departing
    * a customer leaving the queue, advancing to a teller and beginning their
    transaction

### The limits of simulation parameters

* Maximum number of tellers     10
* Maximum simulation length     10000
* Maximum transaction time      500
* Maximum customer queue limit  50
* Probability of a new customer 1% - 100%

### Input parameters and customer (random/file) data

The following data are read at the beginning of the simulation:

* int numTellers;         // number of tellers
* int simulationTime;     // time to run simulation
* int customerQLimit;     // customer queue limit
* int chancesOfArrival;   // probability of a new customer (1 - 100)
* int maxTransactionTime; // maximum transaction time per customer
* int dataSource;         // data source: from file or random

##### Sample input layout:
```
$ java simulator.TellerFlowOptimizer

	***  Get Simulation Parameters  ***

Enter simulation time (max is 10000): 10
Enter maximum transaction time of customers (max is 500): 5
Enter chances (0% < & <= 100%) of new customer: 75
Enter the number of tellers (max is 10): 3
Enter customer queue limit (max is 50): 2
Enter 1/0 to get data from file/Random: 1
Reading data from file. Enter file name: DataFile
```

In each time unit of the simulation, the program needs two positive integers
to compute: (i) boolean anyNewArrival and (ii) int transactionTime.

A user has two options (1 or 0) to specify the source of those numbers:

For user input 1, numbers are read from a file. A filename should be provided
at the beginning of the simulation. Each line in a datafile should contain two
positive numbers (> 0). A datafile should contain sufficient data for
simulationTime up to 500 units, i.e., at least 500 lines. In each time unit,
anyNewArrival & transactionTime are computed as follows:

    read data1 and data2 from the file;
    anyNewArrival = (((data1 % 100) + 1) <= chancesOfArrival);
    transactionTime = (data2 % maxTransactionTime) + 1;

For user input 0, numbers are generated by method nextInt() in a Random object,
dataRandom, which is constructed at the beginning of the simulation. In
each time unit, anyNewArrival & transactionTime are computed as follows:

    anyNewArrival = ((dataRandom.nextInt(100) + 1) <= chancesOfArrival);
    transactionTime = dataRandom.nextInt(maxTransactionTime) + 1;
